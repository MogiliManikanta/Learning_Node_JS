# In Node.js, dependencies are managed in the package.json file, which specifies each dependency's version. Hereâ€™s how version control works for packages:

# Exact Version (1.0.0): Installs only this specific version.

# Caret (^1.0.0): Installs the latest minor and patch versions, so ^1.0.0 allows any 1.x.x version but not 2.0.0.

# Tilde (~1.0.0): Installs the latest patch version within the specified minor version, so ~1.0.0 allows versions like 1.0.1 but not 1.1.0.
